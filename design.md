 ×100
Relevance of Commentary:

Measures how relevant the commentary is to the ongoing game state.
Calculation:
Use expert evaluation or a scoring model to rate commentary relevance for test scenarios.
Latency:

Time delay between a game event and the commentary output.
Calculation:
Latency (ms)
=
Time of commentary
−
Time of game event
Latency (ms)=Time of commentary−Time of game event
Engagement Score:

User-rated measure of how engaging and entertaining the commentary is.
Calculation:
Collect user feedback on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5) and calculate the average score.
4. In-Game NPC with Advanced Capabilities
Performance Metrics:
Behavior Realism:

Measures how realistic and human-like the NPC's actions and dialogues are.
Calculation:
Conduct user surveys or Turing tests to assess perceived realism.
Goal Achievement Rate:

Measures how effectively the NPC completes assigned tasks or goals.
Calculation:
Goal Achievement Rate (%)
=
Number of goals completed
Total goals assigned
×
100
Goal Achievement Rate (%)= 
Total goals assigned
Number of goals completed
​
 ×100
Adaptive Learning Rate:

Evaluates how quickly the NPC adapts to new game scenarios or player actions.
Calculation:
Compare performance improvements over multiple iterations of the same scenario.
Player Interaction Satisfaction:

Measures player satisfaction with NPC interactions.
Calculation:
Conduct user surveys or gather in-game ratings.
5. Co-Playable Character (CPC) Controlled by AI
Performance Metrics:
Skill Synchronization:

Measures how well the AI-controlled CPC synchronizes with the human player’s actions.
Calculation:
Compare timestamps and outcomes of coordinated actions.
Strategic Contribution:

Evaluates the AI's effectiveness in contributing to team strategy.
Calculation:
Use performance metrics like in-game damage dealt, resources managed, or objectives captured.
Error Rate:

Frequency of errors (e.g., friendly fire, poor positioning) made by the CPC.
Calculation:
Error Rate (%)
=
Number of errors
Total actions
×
100
Error Rate (%)= 
Total actions
Number of errors
​
 ×100
Player Trust Score:

Measures how much the human player trusts the AI companion.
Calculation:
Conduct surveys or analyze in-game behavior, such as how often the player follows or relies on the CPC.
Engagement Score:

Combines user feedback on fun and collaboration levels.
Calculation:
Use post-game surveys or interaction logs for quantitative scoring.
Final Note:
Implement these metrics using a combination of:

Game Logs: For tracking and analyzing agent interactions.
Surveys/Feedback: For subjective measures like satisfaction and engagement.
Automated Testing Frameworks: To simulate scenarios and calculate performance benchmarks.
